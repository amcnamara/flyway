## Native Connectors

MongoDB using JDBC is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release. 
Please use [MongoDB - Native Connectors](<Database Driver Reference/MongoDB/MongoDB - Native Connectors>) instead. 
Native Connectors uses `Mongosh` for better performance.

## Terminology
We have to map Flyway concepts and language rooted in the relational database world to MongoDB - this is how Flyway sees the mapping:
  
| MongoDB Concept | Flyway Concept  |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| database        | database/schema |
| collection      | table           |
| document        | row             |
| transaction     | transaction     |

## Using Flyway with MongoDB

### Pre-requisites

- Using Flyway with Maven?
    - Include the latest Flyway MongoDB dependency [here](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.flywaydb/flyway-database-mongodb) in your pom
        - For example:
            - Redgate
              ```xml
              <dependency>
                  <groupId>com.redgate.flyway</groupId>
                  <artifactId>flyway-database-mongodb</artifactId>
              </dependency>
              ```
            - Open Source
              ```xml
              <dependency>
                  <groupId>org.flywaydb</groupId>
                  <artifactId>flyway-database-mongodb</artifactId>
              </dependency>
              ```
    - Include the latest MongoDB driver dependency [here](https://github.com/DataGrip/mongo-jdbc-driver) in your buildscript or import into your local maven repository:
        - For example:
          ```xml
              <dependency>
                  <groupId>com.github.kornilova203</groupId>
                  <artifactId>mongo-jdbc-driver</artifactId>
                  <version>1.19</version>
                  <scope>system</scope>
                  <systemPath>mongo-jdbc-standalone-1.19.jar</systemPath>  
              </dependency>
          ```
        - or `mvn install:install-file -Dfile=mongo-jdbc-standalone-1.19.jar -DgroupId=com.github.kornilova203 -DartifactId=mongo-jdbc-driver -Dversion=1.19 -Dpackaging=jar -DgeneratePom=true`

- Using Flyway with Gradle?
    - Include the latest Flyway MongoDB dependency [here](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.flywaydb/flyway-database-mongodb) as a buildscript dependency
    - Include the latest MongoDB driver dependency [here](https://github.com/DataGrip/mongo-jdbc-driver) in your buildscript
        - For example:
      ```groovy
        dependencies {
          implementation files('mongo-jdbc-standalone-1.19.jar')
        }
      ```

### Configuring Flyway

You must configure a JDBC URL that points to your database. You can configure a connection using this sample URL as an example:

`jdbc:mongodb://ip address:port number/database-name`

We need to fetch three things to complete this url:

- `ip address`
- `port number` _(optional)_
- `database_name` _(optional)_

### MongoDB Scripts

Migrations in mongo are not `.sql` files like the flyway norm, but instead are `.js`. With standard configuration, flyway will still look for `.sql` files as migrations, but when executing them will expect them to contain `javascript`.

To make this more of a native Mongo experience, we recommend changing the [sqlMigrationSuffixes](<Configuration/Flyway Namespace/Flyway SQL Migration Suffixes Setting>) configuration to `.js`. This can be done in your TOML configuration as such:

```
[flyway]
sqlMigrationSuffixes = [".js"]
```

### Limitations

- You can't currently do a [Dry-run](<https://documentation.red-gate.com/fd/migration-command-dry-runs-275218517.html>) operation with MongoDB.

### Known issues

- Performance connecting to MongoDB can be slow. This is a known issue in the driver we are using. It should only impact initial connection so will not impact larger or many migrations. We are investigating solutions to this.
- When you see the output of flyway, the migration will be described as type `SQL`. Don't worry, this is just how Flyway describes a versioned migration - your migration hasn't been changed on its way through Flyway !
